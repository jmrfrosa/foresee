# Foresee

Sound visualization library using `three.js`. Initial code inspired by [Prakhar Bhardwaj's article](https://medium.com/@mag_ops/music-visualiser-with-three-js-web-audio-api-b30175e7b5ba). Short-term objective is to make it compatible with any AudioContext input.

## Running

This project uses `parcel-bundler`. Just:
```
npm install
```

And:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch an auto-reloading development server.
